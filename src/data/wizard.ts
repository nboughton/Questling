For instance, you may set out to learn the true history of a species, identify who and where the most powerful being is, discover the location of a secret object, or become generally accustomed to the beliefs and practices of a culture. You cannot use the spell for things that one mind could not reasonably possess (for instance, by asking for â€œall the worldâ€™s knowledge").
